        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Enchanted Kingdom is located in Santa Rosa, Laguna, Philippines.</p>
        <p><strong>History:</strong> Enchanted Kingdom was opened in 1995 and is owned and operated by Enchanted Kingdom Inc, and company owner Mario Mamon. It is the first and largest theme park in the Philippines, featuring various themed zones and rides.</p>
        <p><strong>Why is it memorable?</strong> It is my favorite location since every Christmas year, me and my family get to enjoy the rides and spend quality time together.</p>
